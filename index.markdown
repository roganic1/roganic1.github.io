## Research Importance
Machine learning models are becoming more embedded in our everyday lives. Without a diverse and inclusive dataset, models will be inaccurate for people on the edges of the population, including those with disabilities. However, researchers are motivated by general success of their model, and it has not been demonstrated that including representative data from the edges of the population improve overall performance on the general population. Therefore, representation in datasets remains a significant challenge.

## Theoretical Lenses   
My research draws from the intersection of several theoretical lenses:
