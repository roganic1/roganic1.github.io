## Research Statement
My broad research interests involve the intersections of machine learning and accessibility. More specifically, facial expressions are a core part of American Sign Language (ASL) , but facial expression recognition technologies for ASL are very immature. I am interested in developing diverse and inclusive datasets to ensure that these technologies empower the Deaf community rather than discriminate against them.
